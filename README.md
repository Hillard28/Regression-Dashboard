# Regression-Dashboard
Dashboard for running regression analyses on datasets

As of now, this code is meant to be run on a specific dataset and won't run unless adjusted for a user's own data. Next steps are to adapt code to handle user-imported files so that users can interact with their own data.

Big huge credit to the Plotly/Dash team for their dash-regression example, which I've used as the basis for a lot of this work.
